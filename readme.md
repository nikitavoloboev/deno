# Deno

> Deno libraries + testing code

This repo is exploring use of [Deno](https://deno.land/).

Main repo with TS code I mostly run with [Bun](https://bun.sh/) is [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/ts).

[Exported libraries](https://deno.land/x/nikiv/lib) to use from Deno.land are found in [lib](lib).

## File structure

- [lib](lib) - Deno libraries
- [src](src) - testing out Deno code
  - [main.ts](src/main.ts) - use file to run code quickly

## Setup

Everything is driven using [Deno tasks](https://deno.land/manual/tools/task_runner).

## Run

```
deno task dev
```

Runs: `deno run --watch -q -A --unstable src/main.ts`

## Publish libraries

## Contribute

The tasks to do are outlined in [existing issues](../../issues) and in [tasks below](#tasks) (sorted by priority).
