# Deno

> Deno libraries and other code

This repo is exploring use of [Deno](https://deno.com/).

Main repo with TS code I mostly run with [Bun](https://bun.sh/) is [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/ts).

[Exported libraries](https://deno.land/x/nikiv/lib) to use from [Deno.land](https://deno.land) are found in [lib](lib).

## File structure

- [lib](lib) - Deno libraries
- [src](src) - testing out Deno code
  - [main.ts](src/main.ts) - use file to run code quickly

## Setup

Everything is driven using [Deno tasks](https://deno.land/manual/tools/task_runner).

## Run

```
deno task dev
```

Runs: `deno run --watch -q -A --unstable src/main.ts`

## Publish libraries

## Contribute

Always open to useful ideas or fixes in form of issues or PRs.

Can [open new issue](../../issues/new/choose) (search [existing issues](../../issues) first) or [start discussion](../../discussions).

It's okay to submit draft PR as you can get help along the way to make it merge ready.
