# Deno libraries

I mainly use [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for running code now and share my TS libraries with it [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/ts).

[Deno](https://deno.land/) is interesting though and am exploring using it more. Perhaps I will automate creating of Deno libraries to Deno.land in future.

[Exported libraries](https://deno.land/x/nikiv/lib) to use from Deno.land are found in [lib](lib).

## Develop

```
deno task dev
```

Make edits to [run.ts](run.ts) file.
