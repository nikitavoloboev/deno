# Deno libraries

I mainly use [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for running code now and share my TS libraries with it [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/ts).

[Deno](https://deno.land/) is interesting though and am exploring using it more. Perhaps I will automate creating of Deno libraries to Deno.land in future.

For now I expose only some things on [Deno.land](https://deno.land/x/nikiv/lib).

## Develop

```
deno task dev
```

Make edits to [run.ts](run.ts) file.
